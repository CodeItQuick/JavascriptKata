Current Test Coverage:
- Basic Hello World string generation
- Generator sequence validation
- Completion state check

All tests appear to be effective at catching mutations, with thorough coverage of:
- String literal mutations
- Block statement mutations
- Generator functionality

No additional tests needed as the current test suite provides complete coverage for this simple implementation.
