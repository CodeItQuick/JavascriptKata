## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 1

The existing tests are effectively catching mutations:
1. Block Statement mutation - Killed
   - Attempted to replace the generator function body with empty block
   - Caught by test "should return hello world"

2. String Literal mutation - Killed
   - Attempted to replace "Hello" with empty string
   - Caught by test "should return hello world"

No uncaught mutations found - code appears to be well-tested.
