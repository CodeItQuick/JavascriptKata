1. Array Initialization Bug
   - The `closeUnits` array initialization in Zergling could be problematic
   - Mutation of empty array survived tests, suggesting insufficient edge cases

2. Attack Logic Vulnerabilities
   - The conditional check in Zergling's attack method could be bypassed
   - No validation of negative damage values
   - The `closeUnits.includes()` check might need additional test cases

3. Health System Issues
   - Marine's `alive()` method always returns true, not considering hitpoints
   - No maximum health validation
   - Damage calculation mutations survived, suggesting potential arithmetic issues

4. Test Coverage Gaps
   - No tests for multiple units in closeUnits array
   - Missing edge cases for health boundaries
   - No tests for concurrent attacks

## Suggested Additional Test Cases
1. Test Zergling with multiple close units
2. Test health boundaries and negative health
3. Test invalid damage values
4. Test Marine's proper health tracking
5. Test unit death conditions comprehensively
