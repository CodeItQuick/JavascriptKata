## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 6

Note: This kata is identical to Kata 3, implementing the same StarCraft-inspired combat system.

Current Implementation Issues:
1. Marine's alive() method always returns true regardless of hitpoints
2. Zealot's alive() method always returns true regardless of hitpoints
3. No validation for damage values

Test Coverage Gaps:
1. No tests for Marine/Zealot death conditions
2. Missing tests for multi-unit combat
3. No validation for negative damage
4. No tests for Marine vs Zealot interactions

The implementation shares the same bugs and test coverage gaps as Kata 3.
