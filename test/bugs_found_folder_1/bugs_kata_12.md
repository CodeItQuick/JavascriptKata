## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 12

Note: This kata is identical to Katas 3, 6, and 9, implementing the StarCraft combat system.

Implementation Issues:
1. Marine and Zealot alive() methods are incorrect (always return true)
2. No damage validation in hurt() methods
3. Potential memory leak in Zergling's closeUnits array

Test Coverage Needs:
1. Unit death conditions
2. Health tracking accuracy
3. Combat sequence validation
4. Unit proximity mechanics
5. Multi-unit engagement scenarios
