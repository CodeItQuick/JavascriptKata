## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 15

Note: This kata is identical to Katas 3, 6, 9, and 12, implementing the StarCraft combat system.

Current Implementation Issues:
1. Marine and Zealot alive() methods incorrectly return true always
2. No validation on damage values
3. Potential memory issues in Zergling's closeUnits array management

Test Coverage Needs:
1. Proper health tracking for all units
2. Combat sequence validation
3. Unit proximity mechanics
4. Multi-unit combat scenarios
5. Death state verification
