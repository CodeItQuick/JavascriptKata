## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 5

Note: This kata is identical to Kata 2, implementing the same pricing calculator functionality.

Current Test Coverage:
- State tax calculations for all states (UT, NV, TX, AL, CA)
- Volume discount thresholds
- Zero item case

Potential Areas for Additional Testing:
1. Edge cases at discount boundaries
2. Invalid state codes
3. Negative numbers for quantity or price
4. Non-numeric inputs
5. String parsing validation

The implementation and test coverage mirror Kata 2, with the same potential areas for improvement.
