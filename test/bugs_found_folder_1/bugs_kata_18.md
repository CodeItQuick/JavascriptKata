## Mutation Testing Results for Kata 18

Note: This kata is identical to Katas 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, implementing the StarCraft combat system.

Implementation Issues:
1. Marine and Zealot alive() methods are incorrect (always return true)
2. No input validation for damage values
3. Potential memory management issues in Zergling's closeUnits array

Test Coverage Needs:
1. Unit death verification
2. Health tracking accuracy
3. Combat order validation
4. Multi-unit engagement scenarios
5. Memory leak prevention in target tracking
